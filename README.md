This is a project that detects eyeblinks via thresholds and executes a respective function of choice. For my particular use case, I mapped each threshold to a left and right keypress, with the intentions of controlling a slideshow.

Utils functions have been adopted from https://github.com/NeuroTechX/bci-workshop/blob/master/python/bci_workshop_tools.py.

Code partially sourced from https://github.com/SabeehHassany/museEEG.
